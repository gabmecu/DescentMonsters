    <string name="about_description_value">\tIn most of the encounters, the overlord
may add a group of monsters belonging to one of the encounter traits. However, filtering
monsters from the monster deck is a tedious task.
\n\tThe goal of this app is to make that filtering process quick and easy, 
helping in the selection of the monster group that fits your needs.</string>
